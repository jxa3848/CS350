Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. the project was learn how to use an embedded system and add to that we see that in mod 3 we created the code to make led lights blink a message then use a button to change the message. in the final project we made a thermostat that show heatings and cool with leds and if active then they pulsed. finally it had to out put that info to a screen and our computer.

What did you do particularly well? I think i did well underatanding what was asked of us and how to code it.

Where could you improve? Being more creative with the project so I could show diffrent skills.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? A book on working in command prompt as I had to google the command to save stuff.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? Learning how to use the Raspberry Pi was a good skill as I can use it for my capstone project or to control devices with wifi like door locks.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Useing the Raspberry Pi makes it all 3 you can adapt the cose gor the gpios to do what ever you want. Its easy to read in python. Finally it is also easy to maintaing as you can do it over wifi and with the pins being labled you will know what you are changing.
